    <section>
        <p>By using <strong>CryptFile</strong>, you agree to the following terms and conditions provided by <strong>StrickerJoy Studios</strong>. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the application.</p>

    <div class="critical-warning">
        <h3>1. Mandatory Password Responsibility</h3>
        <p><strong>StrickerJoy Studios cannot recover, reset, or bypass passwords for any files encrypted using CryptFile.</strong></p>
        <p>Because the app does not store passwords or keys on any server, we have no technical means to assist you if a password is forgotten. If you lose your password, the data contained within the encrypted file will be <strong>permanently lost</strong>. Users are advised to remember that passwords are handled as all-lowercase and should be kept in a secure password manager.</p>

To the maximum extent permitted by law, StrickerJoy Studios disclaims all warranties, including the warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the software will be error-free or that the encryption will be impenetrable against all future cryptographic advancements.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Under no circumstances shall StrickerJoy Studios or its developers be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
